<li>Combine a quarter of room temperature butter with kosher salt, pepper and turkey seasoning to make a paste to cover the turkey and under the skin.</li>
<li>Tuck the wings under itself so they do not burn.</li>
<li>The size of the turkey will determine the cooking time. Place a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the bird.</li>
<li>The calculations for cooking time is as follows: 10 minutes for every weight listed on the tag.</li>
<li>16 lb x 10 = 160 minutes or 2 hours and 40 minutes.</li>
<li>The meat thermometer must be oven proof and will remain in the bird while cooking.</li>
<li>The turkey must be 165 degrees F internal temperature to ensure that it is safe for consumption</li>
<li>Place wood chips in the bottom of the machine. Keep an eye on the wood chips and replace when necessary.</li>
<li>Place the turkey in the machine and set control to high. Put the timer on.</li>
<li>This is an outdoor machine. Do not cook in the home or garage.</li>

<li>Start the turkey stock. Place the giblets, neck, onion with skin, celery, turkey seasoning, and pepper into a saucepan with water on medium heat.</li>
<li>Let the stock cook for 1-2 hours and lower the heat to simmer.</li>
<li>Strain the stock for the pan drippings.</li>
<li>Check the turkey, pan drippings, wood chips, and internal temperature.</li>
<li>Retrieve the turkey and pan drippings when the timer goes off and or the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.</li>
<li>Attempt to remove the fat from the pan drippings.</li>
<li>Make a roux from the flour and 1/4 cup of reduced stock in a saucepan. Keep stirring so there are no lumps.</li>
<li>Pour the pan drippings into the roux and reduced stock mixture. If more stock is necessary, add more stock. Season to taste.</li>
